**SIMPLER Performance**. Success rates of the autoaggressive policy OpenVLA and the diffusion-based policies Octo and $\pi_0$ integrated w/ or w/o PCD on 9 tasks from Google Robot and WidowX.
Task-specific objects in the *initial* observation are annotated by artificial *Point* and *Box* prompts or the automatic detection results of Grounding DINO.
**As a plug-and-play approach, PCD consistently enhances the three policies by large margins over the 9 tasks.**
