(a) VLAs typically predict actions relying on *Spurious Correlations* learned by the direct observation-to-action mapping mechanism.
(b) The core idea of our InSpire method that tackles spurious correlations by boosting the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLAs.
(c) InSpire can be used as a *plugin* to improve state-of-the-art VLAs on both seen and unseen tasks across simulation and real-world environments. 
For illustrative purposes, we omit the tokens of the language instruction "pick up the black bowl next to the plate and place it on the plate".
