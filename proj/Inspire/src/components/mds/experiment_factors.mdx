**Robustness to various kinds of spurious correlations.**
Performance of baseline policies integraged w/ or w/o our proposed PCD approach in unseen testing scenarios. 
OpenVLA and $\pi_0$ are used as baselines in simulation and real-world environments, respectively.
**PCD effectively mitigates the side effects of various types of spurious correlations, boosting the robot policy's generalization to novel scenarios.**
