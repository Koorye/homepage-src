**Overview**. 
InSpire boosts the VLA's spatial reasoning ability by appending the question **"In which direction is the [object] relative to the robot?"** before the language instruction and aligning the VLA's answer **"right/left/up/down/front/back/grasped"** and predicted actions with the ground-truth.
InSpire is compatible with existing autoregressive VLAs.
